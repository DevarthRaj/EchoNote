However, the load_dataset(streaming=True) call is still failing with the same NotImplementedError: Loading a streaming dataset cached in a LocalFileSystem is not supported yet.

As previously discussed, this specific error points to a limitation or issue within the datasets library's streaming capabilities when dealing with datasets cached in a LocalFileSystem. This is likely related to how the Common Voice 13.0 dataset's builder script is structured or how the datasets library interacts with its cached files for this specific configuration ('ml').

Since you've updated the code and the hf_hub_download worked, the NameError is resolved, and you've confirmed the file path. The remaining error with load_dataset requires a different approach.

Here are the next steps you can take:

Ensure datasets is up-to-date: You already have a comment suggesting this. Run the !pip install -U datasets command to make sure you are using the latest version of the library. Sometimes, such NotImplementedError issues are fixed in newer releases.
!pip install -U datasets --quiet
Use code with caution
Try streaming=False again: Although the traceback for streaming=False in your original attempt isn't shown, the comment The specific error 'Loading a dataset cached in a LocalFileSystem is not supported' for streaming=False suggests a similar underlying issue. However, it's worth trying again after updating the datasets library. If streaming=False does work, you might proceed with that approach, keeping in mind that it will download and process the entire dataset split locally, which might require significant disk space and time.
